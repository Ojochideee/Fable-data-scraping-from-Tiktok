# FABLE â€“ The New Social Media App for BookTokers

This project analyzes TikTok data related to Fable, a new app gaining popularity among BookTok users. Data was scraped using Apify, cleaned and prepared in Python, and visualized using Tableau.

## Tools Used
- Apify (TikTok Scraper)
- Python (Pandas, NumPy)
- Jupyter Notebook

## Data Preparation
- Merged hashtag columns into one

Data cleaning was straightforward. Once I understood what insights I wanted, the preprocessing steps naturally followed.
